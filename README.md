### Gameplay Notes:

There is a minimum amount of random encounters when exploring/traveling between areas. However, you can continue to explore after the minimum.<br>
Sarms can be bought multiple times, but only upgrades your current weapon.<br>
Returning to areas is encouraged.<br>
Hostile encounters can be avoided by paying money. Exceptions are wimpy characters that can't be paid off, and fat characters that can't chase you. <br>
Taking the NFT puts the game in hard mode... but also unlocks secret alliance.<br>
Snoop dogg is a crip.<br>
Do not sexually harass the metaverse employees.<br>
Grandma's pie is more than just a snack. <br>
Every item in the store has a purpose.<br>
Demon's blood doesn't actually do anything. Deal with it.<br>
