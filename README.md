##Gameplay Notes:

There is a minimum amount of random encounters when exploring/traveling between areas. However, you can continue to explore after the minimum.
Sarms can be bought multiple times, but only upgrades your current weapon.
Returning to areas is encouraged.
Hostile encounters can be avoided by paying money. Exceptions are wimpy characters that can't be paid off, and fat characters that can't chase you. 
Taking the NFT puts the game in hard mode... but also unlocks secret alliance.
Snoop dogg is a crip.
Do not sexually harass the metaverse employees.
Grandma's pie is more than just a snack. 
Every item in the store has a purpose.
Demon's blood doesn't actually do anything. Deal with it.
